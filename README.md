# Python QRCode Generator
A Quick Response Code or a QR Code is a two-dimensional bar code used for its fast readability and comparatively large storage capacity. It consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background.

Python has a `pyqrcode` library for generating QR code images. It can be installed using pip.

You can also try this in just a matter or 5 to 10 lines of code.

Let's get started!

# Step 1 : Install required modules

```sh
pip install pyqrcode
```
```sh
pip install png
```

# Step 2 :Import all libraries

```python
import pyqrcode

import png

from pyqrcode import QRCode
```

# Step 3 : Generate QRCode using `QRCode` method

Give your url to which you want to create a QRCode and create QRCODE using `qrcode.create()` method.

# Step 4 : Save the QRCode
 save the generated QRcode using `png` module.

Done!!!👍😊🥳🥳🥳
